<b><h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:signpainter;font-style:bold;> align="center"> ABOUT ME </h1>
<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px"> 
  I am a freshman at the McCombs School of Business hoping to major in International Business, Marketing or Management and am also pursuing a Business-Spanish certificate. I grew up in Montgomery, TX (the birthplace of the Texas flag), and I am the oldest out of 3 children. If I could have brunch (brunch is better than lunch) with anyone, it would be Will Ferrell because humor and intellect are the best combination in the world. I love to find cool coffeeshops and going to cheap (free is even better) concerts. </p>
